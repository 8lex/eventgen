# The Splunk Event Generator

The Splunk Event Generator is a utility which allows its user to easily build real-time event generators.
The current maintainers of this project are Brian Bingham (bbingham@splunk.com) and Tony Lee (tonyl@splunk.com).

The goals of this project are ambitious but simple:

* Eliminate the need for hand coded event generators in Splunk apps.
* Allow for portability of event generators between applications, and allow templates to be quickly adapted between use cases.
* Allow every type of event or transaction to be modeled inside Eventgen.

To get you started, please read our documentation

* Splunk internal Eventgen Documentation: go/eventgendocs OR
* Install "Gitbook" and serve the documentation directory
